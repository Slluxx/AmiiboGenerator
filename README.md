### Note:

It needs internet to download the amiibo database from [here](https://www.amiiboapi.com/api/amiibo/), though you can download it manually and place it in `sdmc:/emuiibo/amiibos.json`, which skips the check.

The homebrew does not generate amiibo.bin dumps and does not contain anything stolen from nintendo.
It only generates json files that emuiibo can use. They are exactly the same ones than the ones generated by emutool.

Downloading amiibos with images will take a while. The tool automatically resizes them for space & speed and converts RGB to RGBA if nessesary.
